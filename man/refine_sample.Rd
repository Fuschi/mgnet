\title{Refines Sample Selection in \code{mgnet} or \code{mgnetList} Objects}
\usage{
refine_sample(object, ..., condition = "AND")
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An \code{mgnet} or \code{mgnetList} object.}

\item{...}{Criteria for sample selection: logical vectors, numeric indices, sample names,
or functions returning such indices. These criteria determine which samples are retained.}

\item{condition}{Logical condition to combine multiple criteria: "AND" (default) or "OR".
"AND" requires all criteria to be met, "OR" requires any criterion to be met.}
}
\value{
A modified \code{mgnet} object with only the selected samples, or an \code{mgnetList} with
each contained \code{mgnet} object filtered accordingly.
}
\description{
This function refines the selection of samples within an \code{mgnet} object or across
\code{mgnet} objects within an \code{mgnetList}. It enables the specification of criteria
for which samples to retain, supporting logical vectors, numeric indices, sample names,
or custom functions for dynamic selection.
}
\details{
This function allows for advanced sample selection by applying the specified criteria
directly to the sample data within an \code{mgnet} object. When provided with multiple criteria,
these are combined according to the specified logical condition. For \code{mgnetList} objects,
the function applies the selection process to each contained \code{mgnet} object independently,
facilitating bulk operations.
