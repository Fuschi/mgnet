\title{Filter Taxa in mgnet Objects Based on Taxonomic and Metadata Conditions}
\usage{
filter_info_taxa(object, ..., trim = "yes", aggregate_to = NULL, .by = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An \code{mgnet} or \code{mgnetList} object.}

\item{...}{Conditions for filtering taxa, passed unquoted and allowing for
dplyr-style filtering expressions. These conditions apply to columns in the
merged dataset from \code{info_taxa}, \code{lineage} and the communities membership from \code{community} slots.}

\item{trim}{How to handle taxa not meeting criteria: "yes" to remove them,
"no" to set their abundance to zero (min sample value for norm_abundance),
or "aggregate" to combine them into a single category.}

\item{aggregate_to}{Name for the aggregated taxa category when using \code{trim = "aggregate"}.
Defaults to "aggregate".}

\item{.by}{Optional; a character vector specifying the columns in the \code{info_taxa},
\code{lineage} and communities membership from \code{community} data frame on which to group the
data before applying the filter conditions.
This allows for complex, group-based filtering operations such as filtering
within subsets defined by one or more attributes.}
}
\value{
An \code{mgnet} or \code{mgnetList} object with the taxa subset according to the
specified conditions. The structure of the object remains intact, but taxa that
do not meet the conditions are removed from the abundance data, lineage information,
and potentially network and community analysis results.
}
\description{
This function filters taxa in an \code{mgnet} object or each \code{mgnet} object within
an \code{mgnetList} based on specified conditions applied to the merged data from
the \code{info_taxa} and \code{lineage} slots. This enables filtering taxa using both
taxonomic classification and additional taxa metadata.
}
\details{
The function first merges \code{info_taxa} data with \code{lineage} data and
communities membership from \code{community}to create a comprehensive taxonomic dataset.
It then filters this dataset based on the provided conditions, identifying which taxa to retain.
The resulting filtered taxa list is used to subset the original \code{mgnet} or \code{mgnetList} object,
thus affecting related abundance and network data but not altering the sample metadata.
