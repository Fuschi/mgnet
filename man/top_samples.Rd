\title{Return Ordered the Sample IDs Based on Aggregate Metrics on Abundances Matrices}
\usage{
top_samples(object, field, rank = NULL, order_fun = sum, decreasing = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An \code{mgnet} object.}

\item{field}{Character string specifying the data field to use for computing the metric.
Acceptable values are \code{"abundance"}, \code{"rel_abundance"}, or \code{"norm_abundance"}.
The field must not be empty in the \code{mgnet} object.}

\item{rank}{Optional character string specifying the taxonomic rank to consider when calculating metrics.
If provided, the computation aggregates data at this taxonomic rank within the \code{lineage} data.
Note: Aggregating data at different taxonomic levels may sum taxa classified together,
potentially affecting the interpretability of normalized matrices.}

\item{order_fun}{Function used to compute the aggregate metric across the selected field. The default
is \code{sum}, but other functions like \code{mean} or \code{median} can be used to tailor the analysis.}

\item{decreasing}{Logical indicating if sorting should be in decreasing order. When \code{TRUE} (default),
samples with the highest metric values are considered top.}
}
\value{
For \code{mgnet} objects, a character vector of sample IDs representing the ordered samples.
For \code{mgnetList} objects, returns a list where each element is a character vector of
the ordered samples for each respective \code{mgnet}.
}
\description{
Return the ordered samples from an \code{mgnet} object based on an aggregate metric calculated from
specified data fields such as abundance, relative abundance, or normalized abundance, with
the chosen metric, which can be customized.
}
\note{
Ensure that the specified field is not empty in the \code{mgnet} object before calling this function.
Failing to do so will result in an error. Aggregating data at different taxonomic levels
is the result of summing up the same taxa together and not always it has sense for norm_abundance.
