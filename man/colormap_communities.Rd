\title{Create Color Palette for Community Visualization}
\usage{
colormap_communities(
  community,
  sizes_threshold,
  smaller_color = "#D3D3D3",
  isolated_color = "#FFFFFF",
  colorspace = "pretty",
  alpha = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{community}{An object representing community data, typically derived from a community detection
method such as those available in the \code{igraph} package.}

\item{sizes_threshold}{An integer specifying the minimum size a community must exceed to receive a
unique color. If it missing the function generate color for all the communities also with size 2.
Communities not meeting this size threshold will be assigned the \code{smaller_color}.}

\item{smaller_color}{A hexadecimal color code used for communities that do not exceed the size threshold,
defaulting to a light gray ("#D3D3D3").}

\item{isolated_color}{A hexadecimal color code used for isolated nodes, often represented as community '0',
defaulting to white ("#FFFFFF").}

\item{colorspace}{Specifies the color space from which to generate the palette. Available options include
'pretty', 'pretty_dark', 'rainbow', 'pastels', or a custom list detailing the 'h' (hue), 's' (saturation),
and 'l' (lightness) components. For detailed settings, refer to the \code{qualpalr} documentation.}

\item{alpha}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 that specifies the opacity of the colors, where 1 is fully opaque
and 0 is fully transparent.}
}
\value{
A named vector of colors in hexadecimal format. The vector's names correspond to community IDs,
with '0' typically representing isolated nodes. Each community exceeding the size threshold is assigned
a unique color from the generated palette, while others receive the \code{smaller_color}.
}
\description{
Generates a visually distinct color palette for representing community memberships in network
visualizations. The palette is tailored to emphasize larger communities by providing unique colors
for those that exceed a size threshold. Smaller communities and isolated nodes receive a common or
default color to maintain visual clarity. This function uses the \code{qualpalr} package for color generation,
supporting up to 99 distinct communities due to practical limits on visual distinction.
