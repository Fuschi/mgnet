\title{Internal: Assert Unique Row and Column Names}
\usage{
.assertUniqueRowColNames(obj, errors)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{The object to check, which must be either a matrix or a data.frame.
The function verifies that this object has non-null, unique row and column names.}

\item{errors}{A character vector accumulating error messages from validation checks.}
}
\value{
Returns the updated \code{errors} character vector. If no new validation issues are identified,
the vector is returned unchanged. If issues are found, corresponding error messages are
appended to the vector before it is returned, thereby accumulating messages across
different validation checks.
}
\description{
Validates the presence and uniqueness of row and column names for a given object,
either a matrix or a data.frame. This function is essential for maintaining data
integrity within the \code{mgnet} class by ensuring that identifiers are both provided
and uniquely identify each row and column. Error messages from the validation process
are accumulated in an external vector, allowing for comprehensive feedback on data issues.
