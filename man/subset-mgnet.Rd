\title{Subset mgnet Object}
\usage{
\S4method{[}{mgnet}(x, i, j, ..., drop = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An \code{mgnet} object to be subsetted.}

\item{i}{Indices or a logical vector selecting \strong{samples}. If missing, all samples are included.}

\item{j}{Indices or a logical vector selecting \strong{taxa}. If missing, all taxa are included.}

\item{...}{Ignored. Present only for compatibility with the S4 \code{[} signature.}

\item{drop}{Ignored. Always treated as \code{FALSE}; passing \code{drop = TRUE} has no effect.}
}
\value{
A new \code{mgnet} object containing only the requested subset.
}
\description{
Subsets an \code{mgnet} object based on sample (i) and taxa (j) indices.
}
\details{
Subsetting by samples filters abundance matrices and sample metadata; subsetting by taxa
filters taxa-related data and, if present, updates dependent structures accordingly.
Subsetting by samples removes the \code{network} and \code{community} slots; a warning is issued.
