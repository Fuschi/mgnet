}
\value{
The community detection result object stored in the \code{comm} slot for an \code{mgnet} object,
or a list of such objects for an \code{mgnetList} object, each representing the community
detection results of a contained \code{mgnet} object.

\description{
Retrieves the community detection results stored in the \code{comm} slot of an \code{mgnet} object
or each \code{mgnet} object within an \code{mgnetList}. These results are typically derived from network

network interactions.
