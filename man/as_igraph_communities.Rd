\title{Convert mgnet Communities to igraph Format}
\usage{
as_igraph_communities(comm)
}
\arguments{
\item{comm}{An object of class \code{communities}, typically after manipulation or analysis within an \code{mgnet} context.}
}
\value{
The modified \code{comm} object with isolated nodes assigned unique community numbers,
starting from the highest existing community number + 1. The overall structure of \code{comm}
remains unchanged, with modifications applied to the membership vector to reflect \code{igraph} conventions.
}
\description{
Transforms a communities object from the \code{mgnet} format back to \code{igraph} by assigning
unique community numbers to isolated nodes, which are initially grouped under '0' in \code{mgnet}.
This operation facilitates compatibility with \code{igraph}'s community analysis functions by ensuring
each isolated node is treated as its own community.
