\title{Retrieve network graph(s)}
\usage{
netw(object, selected = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An \code{mgnet} or \code{mgnets} object.}

\item{selected}{Logical (default \code{TRUE}). If \code{TRUE}, for each graph
only edges whose \code{link_id} is currently selected (via \code{\link{select_link}})
are kept; otherwise the full graph is returned.}
}
\value{
\itemize{
\item \code{mgnet}: an \code{igraph} object.
\item \code{mgnets}: a named \code{list} of \code{igraph} objects.
}
}
\description{
Return the network stored in the \code{netw} slot.
For an \code{mgnet}, a single \code{igraph} is returned.
For an \code{mgnets}, a named \code{list} of \code{igraph} (one per element).
If the \code{taxa} slot is non-empty, its columns are attached as vertex attributes.
}
\details{
Requires a non-missing network in the object. When \code{selected = TRUE} and no
links are selected, an empty-edge graph is returned for that element.
