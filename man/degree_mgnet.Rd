\title{Calculate Signed and Community-Specific Vertex Degrees in mgnet Objects}
\usage{
degree_mgnet(obj, sign = "all", type = "all")
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{An \code{mgnet} object containing a network structured as an \code{igraph} object.}

\item{sign}{A character string indicating the sign of the edges to consider.
Accepted values are "positive", "negative", or "all".}

\item{type}{A character string indicating the type of community relationship to consider for the
degree calculation. Accepted values are "intra" for edges within the same community,
"extra" for edges between different communities, or "all" for no community-based filtering.}
}
\value{
An integer vector containing the degrees of the vertices. Each element in the vector
corresponds to a vertex in the \code{mgnet} object, ordered according to the vertex order in the
igraph object.
}
\description{
This function computes the degrees of vertices in an \code{mgnet} object based on the signs of edge weights
and the specified relationship to community structure. It allows for focusing on positive, negative,
or all edges, and can differentiate between edges within the same community (intra-community) and
edges between different communities (inter-community).
}
\details{
The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to it, with possible restrictions based on
edge sign and community membership:
\itemize{
\item \code{sign = "positive"}: Only edges with positive weights are considered.
\item \code{sign = "negative"}: Only edges with negative weights are considered.
\item \code{type = "intra"}: Only edges within the same community as the vertex are considered.
\item \code{type = "extra"}: Only edges between different communities are considered.
}

This function is particularly useful for analyzing the connectivity patterns in ecological networks
or social networks where edges are labeled with positive or negative weights to represent different
types of interactions or relationships, and where community structure is an important aspect.
