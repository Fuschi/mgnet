\title{Apply Criteria to Filter Samples Across an mgnetList}
\usage{
filter_criteria_sample(
  object,
  abundance_criteria = NULL,
  relative_criteria = NULL,
  log_abundance_criteria = NULL,
  condition = "AND"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An \code{mgnetList} object.}

\item{abundance_criteria}{A list of functions to be applied to the abundance data matrix.
Each function should take a single row of abundance data as input and return a logical
value indicating whether the sample meets the specified criteria. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{relative_criteria}{A list of functions to be applied to the relative abundance data matrix.
Each function should take a single row of relative abundance data as input and return
a logical value. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{log_abundance_criteria}{A list of functions to be applied to the log-transformed abundance data
matrix. Each function should take a single row of log-transformed abundance data as input
and return a logical value. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{condition}{A character string specifying the logical condition to apply across
the criteria. Options are "AND" (default) and "OR". "AND" requires a sample
to meet all specified criteria to be included, while "OR" requires a sample
to meet at least one criterion.}
}
\value{
A modified \code{mgnetList} object containing only the samples that meet all
specified criteria across all provided data types. Each \code{mgnet} object within the list
is filtered accordingly.
}
\description{
This function allows for filtering samples across all \code{mgnet} objects contained within an \code{mgnetList}
based on specified criteria applied to abundance, relative abundance, and log-transformed
abundance data. Custom functions define the criteria for filtering, allowing for complex and
flexible sample selection processes across multiple datasets.
}
\details{
The \code{filter_criteria_sample} method for \code{mgnetList} iterates over each \code{mgnet} object in the list,
applying the specified filtering criteria to each. This method is useful for batch processing of
multiple datasets where the same filtering logic is desired across all datasets.
