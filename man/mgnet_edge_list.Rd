\title{Retrieve Edge List with Metadata from mgnet Object(s)}
\usage{
mgnet_edge_list(object)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An \code{mgnet} or \code{mgnetList} object.
For \code{mgnet}, the method will extract the network's edge list and merge taxa metadata
for both source and target nodes.
For \code{mgnetList}, the method will apply the transformation to each \code{mgnet} in the list
and bind the results, including an additional column \code{mgnet} to track the source object.}
}
\value{
A dataframe containing the edge list with additional metadata columns for both vertices involved in each link.
For \code{mgnetList} objects, the output is a single dataframe where results from all \code{mgnet} objects are bound together.
}
\description{
Extracts an edge list from the network slot of an \code{mgnet} or \code{mgnetList} object, including edge weights
and associated taxa metadata for both vertices in each link.
}
\details{
This method utilizes the network structure within \code{mgnet} to generate a comprehensive edge list
that includes:
\itemize{
\item \code{source}: The identifier for the source node.
\item \code{target}: The identifier for the target node.
\item \code{weight}: The weight of the edge, if available.
\item Metadata from both source and target taxa, added as additional columns.
}

For \code{mgnetList} objects, the transformation is applied individually to each \code{mgnet} object, and the results
are combined into a single dataframe with an additional column named \code{mgnet} that identifies the source object.
