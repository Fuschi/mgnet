\title{Selection a subset of taxa from mgnet object.}
\usage{
selection_taxa(object, ..., condition="AND",trim=TRUE)

\S4method{selection_taxa}{mgnet}(object, ..., condition = "AND", trim = TRUE)

\S4method{selection_taxa}{list}(object, ..., condition = "AND", trim = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{mgnet.}

\item{...}{arbitrary set of vectors of functions. If vectors they must contain
numeric or name or logical indices to be preserved. If functions they must return
indices as just explained.}

\item{condition}{(Optional default "AND") character indicates the logical operation between indices.}

\item{trim}{(Option default TRUE) logical, if true the discarded taxa are removed from obj otherwise they are only set to zero in data.}
}
\description{
The function takes as input a vector of logical or position
indices to evaluate which taxa to keep.
