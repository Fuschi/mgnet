\title{Mutate Taxa Information based on Abundance Criteria}
\usage{
mutate_criteria_taxa(
  object,
  abundance = NULL,
  rel_abundance = NULL,
  norm_abundance = NULL,
  network = NULL,
  community = NULL,
  mgnet = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An \code{mgnetList} object.}

\item{abundance}{A named list of functions to be applied to the abundance data matrix.
Each function should take a single row of abundance data as input and return the value
to be stored in the \code{info_taxa} slot. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{rel_abundance}{A named list of functions to be applied to the relative abundance data matrix.
Each function should take a single row of relative abundance data as input and return
the value to be stored in the \code{info_taxa} slot. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{norm_abundance}{A named list of functions to be applied to the log-transformed abundance data
matrix. Each function should take a single row of log-transformed abundance data as input
and return the value to be stored in the \code{info_taxa} slot. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{network}{A named list of functions to be applied to the network data matrix.
Each function should take a single column of network data as input and return
the value to be stored in the \code{info_taxa} slot. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{community}{A named list of functions to be applied to the community data matrix.
Each function should take a single column of community data as input and return
the value to be stored in the \code{info_taxa} slot. Default is \code{NULL}.}

\item{mgnet}{A named list of functions to be applied direct on the mgnet object.}
}
\value{
A modified \code{mgnet} object with the \code{info_taxa} slot updated based on the applied mutations.
}
\description{
This function allows for mutating taxa information based on specified criteria applied to
the abundances matrices in an \code{mgnet} object or \code{mgnetList} object.
Custom functions define the criteria for mutation, enabling flexible modification of taxa
information across multiple datasets.
