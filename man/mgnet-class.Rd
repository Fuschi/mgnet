\title{Metagenomic Network (mgnet) Class}
\description{
An S4 class for comprehensive management and analysis of metagenomic networks.
It encapsulates various types of metagenomic data, including abundance matrices,
sample metadata, taxonomic information, and network analysis results.
This class serves as a robust framework for analyzing microbial communities
and their interactions, supporting advanced analysis workflows for metagenomics research.
}
\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{abundance}}{A numeric matrix representing next-generation sequencing (NGS)
data, where rows correspond to samples and columns to taxa, with values indicating
the abundance of each taxa in each sample.}

\item{\code{log_abundance}}{A numeric matrix of log-ratio transformed abundance data,
facilitating compositional data analysis, mirroring the structure of \code{abundance}.}

\item{\code{info_sample}}{A data.frame containing metadata for samples, indexed by sample IDs,
with each row corresponding to a sample and each column to an experimental variable.}

\item{\code{lineage}}{A character matrix with taxonomic classification for each taxa,
where each row corresponds to a taxa and columns to taxonomic ranks such as phylum,
class, order, family, genus, and species.}

\item{\code{info_taxa}}{A data.frame with additional information on taxa, indexed by taxa IDs,
providing a flexible structure for storing diverse metadata related to taxa.}

\item{\code{network}}{An \code{igraph} object representing a network of taxa interactions,
capturing the complex relationships between microbial taxa within the community.}

\item{\code{communities}}{An object storing community detection results, typically obtained
from network analysis, facilitating the exploration of microbial community structure.}
