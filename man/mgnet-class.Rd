\title{MetaGenomic NETwork (mgnet) Class}
\description{
An S4 class for comprehensive management and analysis of metagenomic networks.
It encapsulates various types of microbial data, including abundance matrices,
sample metadata, taxonomic information, and network analysis results.
This class serves as a robust framework for analyzing microbial communities
and their interactions, supporting advanced analysis workflows for metagenomics research.
}
\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{abundance}}{A numeric matrix representing the raw abundance data from
next-generation sequencing (NGS), where rows correspond to samples and columns
to taxa. Each entry indicates the abundance of a taxon in a sample.}

\item{\code{rel_abundance}}{A numeric matrix representing the relative abundance of each taxon
within each sample, mirroring the structure of \code{abundance}. This is calculated as
the proportion of each taxon's abundance relative to the total abundance in the sample.}

\item{\code{norm_abundance}}{A numeric matrix of normalized abundance data, facilitating various
types of analyses. While the default normalization applied is log-ratio transformation
to address compositional data issues, this slot is versatile and can hold other types
of normalized data, such as those obtained from rarefaction, DESeq normalization, etc.}

\item{\code{info_sample}}{A data.frame containing metadata for samples, indexed by sample IDs.}

\item{\code{lineage}}{A character matrix providing taxonomic classification for each taxon.}

\item{\code{info_taxa}}{A data.frame with additional taxa information, indexed by taxa IDs.}

\item{\code{network}}{An \code{igraph} object representing the network of taxa interactions.}

\item{\code{community}}{An object storing community detection results from network analysis.}
}}

\section{Reserved Keywords}{

The \code{mgnet} class reserves keywords for internal use, which should not be used
as column names in the provided matrices or data.frames: \code{sample_id}, \code{taxa_id},
\code{abundance},\code{rel_abundance}, \code{norm_abundance}.
These keywords are utilized for specific functionalities and methods within the \code{mgnet} package.
Using these names as column identifiers in your data may lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

\examples{
# Creating an empty mgnet object
empty_mgnet <- mgnet()

}

\code{\link{mgnet}} for the constructor function.
