\usage{
mgnet(
  abun = matrix(numeric(0), nrow = 0, ncol = 0),
  rela = matrix(numeric(0), nrow = 0, ncol = 0),
  norm = matrix(numeric(0), nrow = 0, ncol = 0),

  comm = igraph::cluster_fast_greedy(igraph::make_empty_graph(n = 0, directed = FALSE))
)
}
\arguments{
\item{abun}{A numeric matrix of raw abundances (e.g., read counts), where rows
represent samples and columns represent features (taxa, genes, etc.).
All values must be ≥ 0. Default is an empty matrix.}

\item{rela}{A numeric matrix of relative abundances, where each value represents
the proportion of a feature in a given sample. Defaults to empty.
All values must be ≥ 0. Default is an empty matrix.}

\item{norm}{A numeric matrix of transformed or normalized abundances, such as
log(CPM), CLR-transformed data, or TPM. Defaults to an empty matrix.}

\item{meta}{A data frame of sample metadata. Defaults an empty data.frame.}

\item{taxa}{A data frame of taxon metadata. Defaults an empty data.frame.}

\item{netw}{An \code{igraph} object representing a feature-level network. Defaults to an empty graph.}

\item{comm}{A \code{communities} object representing detected communities in the network.
Defaults to an empty result based on \code{cluster_fast_greedy}.}
}
\value{
An \code{mgnet} object. If invalid, the constructor halts with an informative error.
}
\description{
An S4 class designed for organizing and managing NGS data in a tidy and modular fashion.
The class stores key components such as abundance matrices (raw, relative, normalized),
sample metadata, feature annotations, network structures, and community assignments.

This constructor creates an \code{mgnet} object designed to encapsulate a single
microbial community dataset derived from high-throughput sequencing techniques.
The object integrates raw, relative and normalized abundance data, sample and taxa metadata, and
a taxon interaction network and its community structure.
}
\details{
This class is designed to integrate NGS data — abundances, metadata, annotations, networks —
with structural consistency checks. It performs no modeling or normalization and focuses on
tidy-style manipulation and coherent data export.
