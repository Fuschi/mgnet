\title{Convert igraph Communities to mgnet Format}
\usage{
as_mgnet_communities(comm)
}
\arguments{
\item{comm}{An object of class \code{communities}, typically obtained from community detection algorithms in \code{igraph}.}
}
\value{
The modified \code{comm} object with isolated nodes reassigned to community '0'.
The structure of \code{comm} is preserved, with changes applied only to the membership vector.
}
\description{
Converts an \code{igraph} communities object to the \code{mgnet} format by reassigning isolated nodes
to a community labeled as '0'. Unlike \code{igraph}, which treats isolated nodes as individual communities,
\code{mgnet} groups all isolated nodes into a single community for analysis purposes.
