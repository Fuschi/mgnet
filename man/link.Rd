\title{Retrieve Edge List with Metadata from mgnet Object(s)}
\usage{
link(object, .suffix = c("_1", "_2"))
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An \code{mgnet} or \code{mgnetList} object.
For \code{mgnet}, the method will extract the network's edge list and merge taxa metadata
for both source and target nodes. For \code{mgnetList} the method will be applied on each element.}

\item{.suffix}{A character vector of length 2 providing suffixes to append to the taxa
metadata columns to distinguish the nodes connected from an edge.
Default is c("_1", "_2"). The values must be distinct to prevent column name overlap.}
}
\description{
Extracts an edge list from the network slot of an \code{mgnet} or \code{mgnetList} object, including edge attributes
and associated taxa metadata for both vertices in each link.
}
\details{
This method leverages the network structure within \code{mgnet} objects to generate a detailed edge tibble that includes:
\itemize{
\item \verb{Node Identifiers}: Each identifier for the nodes connected by an edge begins with the string "taxa" and is
appended with \code{.suffix} to indicate the source and target nodes, respectively (e.g., \code{taxa_id_1}, \code{taxa_id_2}).
\item \verb{Link Attributes}: Includes all available attributes associated with the links, such as weight.
\item \code{Metadata}: Metadata from both source and target taxa are included, with column names appended
with \verb{_1} and \verb{_2} as suffixes. These suffixes help distinguish between the source and target taxa metadata.
}

For \code{mgnetList} objects, this transformation is applied individually to each \code{mgnet} object.
