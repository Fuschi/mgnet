\title{Apply Criteria to Filter Taxa in mgnet Objects}
\usage{
filter_criteria_taxa(
  object,
  abundance = NULL,
  rel_abundance = NULL,
  norm_abundance = NULL,
  condition = "AND",
  trim = "yes",
  aggregate_to = NULL,
  exclude_absent_taxa = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An \code{mgnet} or \code{mgnetList} object.}

\item{abundance}{A list of functions to be applied to the abundance data matrix column-wise.
Each function takes a single column of abundance data as input and returns a logical value
indicating whether the taxa meets the filtering criteria.}

\item{rel_abundance}{A list of functions to be applied to the relative abundance data matrix column-wise.
Each function takes a single column of relative abundance data as input and returns a logical value.}

\item{norm_abundance}{A list of functions to be applied to the log-transformed abundance data matrix column-wise.
Each function takes a single column of log-transformed abundance data as input and returns a logical value.}

\item{condition}{A character string specifying the logical condition to apply across
the criteria. Options are "AND" (default) and "OR". "AND" requires a taxa to meet all specified
criteria to be included, while "OR" requires a taxa to meet at least one criterion.}

\item{trim}{How to handle taxa not meeting criteria: "yes" to remove them,
"no" to set their abundance to zero (min sample value for norm_abundance),
or "aggregate" to combine them into a single category.}

\item{aggregate_to}{Name for the aggregated taxa category when using \code{trim = "aggregate"}.
Defaults to "aggregate".}

\item{exclude_absent_taxa}{A logical value indicating whether to exclude taxa that are absent across all samples
before applying the criteria. Defaults to TRUE.}
}
\value{
A filtered \code{mgnet} object containing only the taxa that meet all
specified criteria, or an \code{mgnetList} with each constituent \code{mgnet}
object filtered accordingly.
}
\description{
This function allows for filtering taxa in an \code{mgnet} object or across
an \code{mgnetList} based on specified criteria applied to abundance, relative abundance,
and log-transformed abundance data column-wise. Custom functions define the criteria for filtering,
allowing for complex and flexible taxa selection processes.
}
\details{
The function evaluates each specified criterion against the data columns (taxa)
in the abundance, relative abundance, and log-transformed abundance matrices.
Taxa that meet all provided criteria across these datasets are retained in the filtered object.
