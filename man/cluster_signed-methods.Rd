\title{Get Communities of a Signed Weighted Graph}
\usage{
cluster_signed(obj, OS)

\S4method{cluster_signed}{igraph,character}(obj, OS)

\S4method{cluster_signed}{mgnet,character}(obj, OS)

\S4method{cluster_signed}{list,character}(obj, OS)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{weighted undirected network belong to \code{\link{igraph}} class
or an mgnet.}

\item{OS}{string with the operating system running. Possible choices are
"Linux","Windows","Mac".}
}
\value{
\code{\link{communities}} igraph object able to manage to communities
graph info. The unique difference from igraph routine is the treatment with
the isolated nodes. In this case all isolated nodes are classified in the
community \code{'0'} and not as different communities of size one
}
\description{
Adaptation in R of the algorithm for detention of weighted
communities with sign of a graph developed by Sergio Gomez.
https://deim.urv.cat/~sergio.gomez/radatools.php.
The algorithm tries to find dense subgraph, also called communities via
optimization of a signed definition of modularity score.
