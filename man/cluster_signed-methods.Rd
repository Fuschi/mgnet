\usage{
cluster_signed(obj, OS = "Linux", add.names = TRUE)

\S4method{cluster_signed}{igraph}(obj, OS = "Linux", add.names = TRUE)

\S4method{cluster_signed}{mgnet}(obj, OS = "Linux", add.names = TRUE)

\S4method{cluster_signed}{list}(obj, OS = "Linux", add.names = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{weighted undirected network belong to \code{\link{igraph}} class
or an mgnet.}

\item{OS}{(default Linux) string with the operating system running. Possible choices are
"Linux","Windows","Mac".}

\item{add.names}{logical with default value set to TRUE. It indicates whether
you want to use the name of the vertices also in the resulting communities or
simply numerical indexes.}
}
\value{
\code{\link{communities}} igraph object able to manage to communities
graph info. The unique difference from igraph routine is the treatment with
the isolated nodes. In this case all isolated nodes are classified in the
community \code{'0'} and not as different communities of size one.

\description{
Adaptation in R of the algorithm for detention of weighted
communities with sign of a graph developed by Sergio Gomez.
https://deim.urv.cat/~sergio.gomez/radatools.php.
The algorithm tries to find dense subgraph, also called communities via
optimization of a signed definition of modularity score.
