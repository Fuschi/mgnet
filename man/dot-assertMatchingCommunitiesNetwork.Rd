\title{Internal: Assert Consistency Between Network and Communities}
\usage{
.assertMatchingCommunitiesNetwork(obj, errors)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{An S4 object containing \code{network} and \code{communities} slots.}

\item{errors}{A character vector that accumulates error messages from various validation checks.
New errors identified by this function are appended to this vector.}
}
\value{
Returns the updated \code{errors} character vector with any new error messages appended.
If the network is missing or if the number of vertices in the network does not match
the number of community assignments, corresponding error messages are added.
}
\description{
Validates the consistency between the network and its associated communities within an S4 object.
This function checks that a network is present and that the number of vertices in the network
matches the number of community assignments. This is essential for ensuring that community
detection results accurately reflect the structure of the network.
}
\details{
The function performs two main checks: first, it verifies that the \code{network} slot
is not empty, indicating that a network structure exists. Second, it compares the
number of vertices in the network (using \code{vcount}) with the length of the community
assignments in the \code{communities$membership} vector. These validations ensure that
community data is aligned with the network's topology.
