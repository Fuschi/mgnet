\title{Internal: Assert igraph Network with Named Vertices}
\usage{
.assertNamedIgraph(obj, errors)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{The object to check, expected to be an igraph network.}

\item{errors}{A character vector for accumulating error messages from validation checks.}
}
\value{
An updated character vector containing any new error messages if \code{obj}
is not an igraph network or if any vertices are unnamed; otherwise,
the original \code{errors} vector is returned.
}
\description{
Validates that the given object is an igraph network and checks that all vertices have names.
This function is crucial for ensuring network data integrity, requiring both the correct
structure and identifiable vertices for further analysis.
