\title{Compute Signed Layout for Graphs Considering Only Positive Edges}
\usage{
layout_signed(object, layout = igraph::with_fr())
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An \code{igraph} or \code{mgnet} or \code{mgnetList} object. If the input is an \code{mgnet} object, the layout is applied to the network (\code{netw}) slot. If the input is an \code{mgnetList} the method returns an named list with all the layouts.}

\item{layout}{A layout specification to be used for computing the graph layout. Defaults to the \code{Fruchterman-Reingold} layout
(\code{with_fr()}), but any layout function from \code{igraph} can be provided.}
}
\value{
A matrix with two columns (for 2D layouts) or three columns (for 3D layouts), containing the coordinates of each vertex.
}
\description{
This function generates a graph layout that only considers positive-weighted edges from a given \code{igraph} or \code{mgnet} object.
By default, the layout uses the Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm (\code{with_fr()}), but it can accept other layout functions from \code{igraph}.
}
\details{
This function focuses on positive-weighted edges in the graph, generating a layout based only on these connections.
If the graph is weighted, edges with positive weights are retained, and negative or zero-weight edges are ignored.
If the graph is unweighted, the function treats all edges as positive.

When no layout function is provided, the Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm is used. However, the user can specify
any valid layout from \code{igraph} to control how the layout is computed.

This function is useful for visualizing graphs where positive interactions (e.g., cooperation, mutualism)
are of primary interest.

\examples{
# Create an example igraph object
g <- igraph::make_ring(10)
E(g)$weight <- c(1, -1, 1, 1, -1, 1, 1, -1, 1, 1)

# Compute layout with only positive edges
coords <- layout_signed(g)

# Plot the graph using the computed layout
plot(g, layout = coords)
