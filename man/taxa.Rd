\title{Get Taxa Information}
\usage{
taxa(object, .fmt)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An \code{mgnet} or \code{mgnetList} object.}

\item{.fmt}{A character string specifying the output format of the result.
Possible choices are:
- "df": Returns the output as a \code{data.frame}.
- "tbl": Returns the output as a \code{tibble}. For \code{mgnet} objects, if present, the row names of
the abundance matrix are converted into a new column named \code{taxa_id}, ensuring alignment
with the reserved keyword in \code{mgnet}.
- "list_df": When working with \code{mgnetList}, returns a list of \code{data.frame} objects,
each corresponding to the \code{taxa} of an individual \code{mgnet} object.
- "list_tbl": Similar to "list_df", but each entry in the list is a \code{tibble}.
- "tbl" (for \code{mgnetList} only): Concatenates the results of all \code{mgnet} objects into a single
\code{tibble}, with an additional column identifying the source \code{mgnet} object. The column is named
\code{mgnet}, which is a reserved keyword of the \code{mgnet} class and contains the name of each \code{mgnet} object.}
}
\value{
The content of the \code{taxa} slot for \code{mgnet} or a list of such contents for \code{mgnetList}.
}
\description{
Retrieves the taxa information stored in the \code{taxa} slot of an \code{mgnet} object
or for each \code{mgnet} object within an \code{mgnetList}, with the option to format the output as
a \code{data.frame}, \code{tibble}, or a combined \code{tibble} for multiple mgnet objects.
